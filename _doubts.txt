0. Why are some of the files in gitignore like pycache still showing in Github?
Milestone 2 - Task 3
1. What is the difference between bounce rates and exit rates?

Milestone 3 
1. Why the first code does not work but second does? First one gives weird values
df['admin_duration_median'] = df.groupby('administrative')['administrative_duration'].median()
df['admin_duration_median'] = df.groupby('administrative')['administrative_duration'].transform('median')

2. In task 3, we need to create a plotter class to visualise removal of NULL. What is this?


3.  In below code, when I use df = drop_null(), null is not dropped. But it works if I create a new dataframe = drop_null. Why?   
    
    def drop_null(self, df: pd.DataFrame, column: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        '''Drops missing values - to be used when percent of missing values are very low'''
        df = df.dropna(subset=[column])
        return df

4. For skewness
- Should I treat variables such as administrative as categorical and not both about skewness?
- How to set appropriate skewness threshold and identify which variables to transform?
- Given CLT, could I have skipped skewness transformation altogether?
- Should I delete original columns that have been transformed?

5. For outliers
- Shouldn't we check this before skewness?
- Swarmplot function takes forever with big dataset. Anyway round it?

6. Why do value counts still return Northern and Southern Africa with zero count? Creates problem when I do groupby sum functions.

7. Analysis and visualisation can be part of main or should be a separate file?
GENERAL
- Why are my gitignore files being pushed to github? E.g., Gitignore is not implementing doubts.txt. So I deleted in on github.com. But then my local and remote differ. Tricky situation
- After pushing unnecessary files, I deleted them in github. That affects history in github vs local. How to solve?
- Should my main file generate all the charts? Doesn't sound useful.
- For correlation heatmap, struggling to get values annotated. Only top row comes with values. Why?
- Why were we asked to save the csv?
